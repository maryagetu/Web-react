# 🍔 Food Delivery App

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Food Delivery App project – something I built because I'm always hungry and thought, "Why not build my own food delivery platform?"

## What's This All About? 🤔

So basically, it's a web app where you can browse through yummy food items, add them to your cart, and pretend you're ordering food (or actually use it if you deploy it!). I built this with React because I wanted to get better at frontend development, and honestly, who doesn't love food?

## What Can You Do Here? 🍕

- **Sign up/Login** - Create an account so you don't lose your favorite items
- **Browse food** - Scroll through all the delicious stuff (warning: may cause hunger!)
- **Add to cart** - Throw in whatever you're craving
- **Change your mind** - Remove items or update quantities (no judgment here)
- **Checkout** - Pretend you're actually ordering (or really order if you set up the backend)

## The Pages I Made 📱

- **Home** - First thing you see, with all the good stuff
- **Cart** - Where your chosen food hangs out
- **Place Order** - For when you're ready to commit
- **Navigation Bar** - So you don't get lost
- **Food Display** - All the food, looking pretty
- **Explore Menu** - Filter by what you're in the mood for
- **Login Popup** - That thing that asks who you are

## What I Used To Build This 🛠️

- **React.js** - The main thing (because I like components)
- **Vite** - Makes everything run fast (nobody likes waiting)
- **CSS** - Made it look decent (or at least I tried!)
- **Git** - So I don't accidentally break everything
